In this programming activity, you will be writing an LC-3 assembly program that will examine a given 16-bit value stored in a given memory location. Your program should count the number of 1s that occur in the given value..
HINT: You can examine each bit of a given value by shifting the value by one bit to the left repeatedly and looking at the resulting value of  MSB (sign bit).
Your program should assume that the initial bit pattern is in memory location labeled PATTERN. Your program should count the number of 1s in PATTERN and store the count in memory location labeled NUM_ONES. Your program should start at memory location x3100
=================================================================
.orig x3100		;start x3100


;R0 will contain the pattern
;R1 will be the loop counter
;R2 will be the number of 1â€™s


LD R0, PATTERN	;load PATTERN into R0
ADD R1,R1,#15	;LOAD R1 w/15 for loop counter
LOOP BRn DONE	;if the counter is negative it is done
ADD R0,R0,#0	; set CC
BRn NEGATIVE 	;if CC is negative go to negative
POSITIVE 
	ADD R0,R0,R0 ;add it to itself to check next
 BR NEXT
NEGATIVE
	ADD R2,R2,#1 ;add 1 to the count of 1s
	ADD R0,R0,R0 ;add it to itself to check next 
	BR NEXT


NEXT
	ADD R1,R1,#-1 ;decrement the loop counter 
	BR LOOP
DONE STI R2, NUM_ONES
Halt


PATTERN .fill xF00F
NUM_ONES .fill x3150
.end
